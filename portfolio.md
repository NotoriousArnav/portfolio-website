## About Me

I'm Arnav Ghosh, a developer with 70+ open-source projects spanning AI, cybersecurity, reverse engineering, embedded systems,full-stack development, and creative tech.
I build tools that solve real problems -- from web scraping APIs and malicious USB detectors to AI-powered database agents and audio samplers for live performance.

As the founder of the BroCode Tech Community, I aim to empower developers through collaboration and open-source contributions.
My interests range from LLM-powered agents and OSINT to bare-metal C on microcontrollers and analog synthesizers.
